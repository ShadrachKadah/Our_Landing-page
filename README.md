Several technological obstacles arose over the course of the project. One of the most challenging issues we encountered was the implementation of a secure payment mechanism. We needed to safeguard sensitive client information while adhering to industry standards for online transactions. This necessitated extensive research and testing. Given the breadth of our MVP and the project's development timeline, we chose to include a robust checkout form to ensure we could provide a secure and reliable checkout experience for our clients.
